# Java-GUI-Battleship
Java GUI Battleship game
This my first Java GUI project. 

FEATURES
- rotating ships
- custom graphics
- opponent targeting algorithm
- point and click firing

BUGS/ISSUES
- Upon restarting the game, the main menu buttons will be out of place
- very rare occurrence that opponent bullet will miss causing a conditional to never be true resulting in an infinite loop.
- Menu background needs a new design
- very rare occurrence that opponent targetting system will not behave correctly.
- sloppy code
